# Pymaceuticals Study Analysis

This project analyzes data from a study conducted by Pymaceuticals, Inc., focusing on potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in mice. The study involved administering various drug regimens and observing tumor volume changes over 45 days.

## Tasks

1. **Prepare the Data**
   - Import packages and data.
   - Merge the data and clean duplicate entries.

2. **Generate Summary Statistics**
   - Calculate mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM for each drug regimen.

3. **Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts**
   - Generate bar and pie charts to visualize the data.

4. **Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot**
   - Analyze the final tumor volume and identify outliers.

5. **Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot**
   - Plot tumor volume over time for a selected mouse and mouse weight versus average tumor volume.

6. **Calculate Correlation and Regression**
   - Compute the correlation coefficient and plot the regression line.

## Results

- Summary statistics showed variations in tumor volume across different treatment regimens.
- The bar and pie charts visualized the distribution of treatments and the gender of mice.
- The box plot highlighted potential outliers
